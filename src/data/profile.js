 summary: ` I'm a Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in building scalable, secure, and cloud-native applications using Java, Spring Boot, React, and AWS. I specialize in designing microservices, automating deployments with CI/CD pipelines, and crafting intelligent solutions across domains like healthcare, finance, and embedded systems. With a passion for problem-solving through data structures and clean system architecture, I also believe that leveraging AI can significantly enhance development efficiency and user experience. I approach every project not just as a developer, but with the mindset of a product owner â€” focused on delivering value, thinking ahead, and building systems that lead the race in today's tech-driven world.
